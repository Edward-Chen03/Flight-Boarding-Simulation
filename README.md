# Flight Boarding Simulation
This project was designed to run a virtual probability simulation of daily activiy of an airport. 

## Features
- Simulation of Airport Activities: Implements a simulation module that replicates various airport activities, encompassing passenger generation, boarding processes, deboarding procedures, delays management, and responses to COVID emergencies. 

## Instructions
To execute, please download the above files and run FlightSimulator.java 

## Project Specifications
- Java Queue: Incorporates a Java Queue data structure to efficiently manage and prioritize all incoming queries and requests. By leveraging the inherent capabilities of a Queue, the system ensures orderly processing of queries, maintaining fairness and integrity in handling user interactions. This implementation enhances system responsiveness, scalability, and reliability, optimizing overall performance and user experience.
